SnStore is an in-memory database which borrows the idea,"shared
nothing", from HSTORE.

For simplicity, it can be a Key-Value store with "get"/"getRange" and
"put" interface. NO SQL queries are requested.

The DB is built on a single multi-core machine.

Every thread is responsible for a partition of the whole key range.
